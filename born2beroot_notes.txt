Operating systems:
- Debian (30 years): free and open-software developed by the community-supported
			Debian Project


- Rocky (3 years): a downstream version of Red Hat operating system


- Difference between Debian/Rocky: Debian, as an older software, can be more
					user-friendly to new users, supporting
					many libraries, filesystems and 
					architeture. It is also better for personal
					use while rocky is better for enterprise. 




Pack managers:
- apt: a collection of tools used to install, update, remove and otherwise manage
	software packages on Debian and its derivative operating systems (including 
	Ubunto and Linux Mint).


- aptitude: a high-level front-end tool for package management


- Difference between apt/aptitude: apt is a low-level package manager and aptitude
					is high-level. This means that with apt
					you gotta tell everything to it to work
					while with aptitude it's automization
					helps you with fixing issues and removing
					unused packages or suggeste installations.
